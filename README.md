# Battery Data Analysis

This project is a battery data analysis tool that helps identify schools with battery issues and devices that are in need of battery replacement.

## Description

This project is built with pure JavaScript (using TypeScript) and provides a battery data analysis tool that helps identify schools with battery issues and devices that require replacement. It takes JSON data containing battery levels, employee IDs, serial numbers, timestamps, and academy IDs, and performs calculations to determine which schools and devices are affected. The tool can be configured to analyze different data sources and provides clear results for further action.
